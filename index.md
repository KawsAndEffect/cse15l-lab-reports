Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

So that's 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each of the 9 examples, include:

- A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output.
- What the absolute path to the working directory was right before the command was run.
- A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
- Indicate explicitly whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error in one or two sentences. Note: Make sure to use backticks ` around keywords such as commands, file names, paths, etc. to make them show up as code like cd.
