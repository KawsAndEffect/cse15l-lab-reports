### Part 2: Reflection
I didn't know how to use vim or jdb at all. Coming from a data science background, I never had experience using either of them. I've heard of vim once before but thought it was just
an alternative IDE like VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc. Another cool thing that I learned about was the filepath names, I really enjoyed that portion since I never really learned in depth
about filepaths. I didn't know all these small things like what `../subdirectory` or `./something` meant. It was very interesting learning about terminal commands like `cat`, `echo`,
`grep`, etc. Small things in the terminal that help out.
